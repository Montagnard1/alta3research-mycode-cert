# alta3research-mycode-cert
API design with Python Certification Project

The objective of this little project is to obtain a Python and RESTful API Certification demonstrating basic proficiency of Python and RESTful APIs.

The script alta3research-flask01.py should demonstrate proficiency with the flask library. Application should have at least two endpoints. At least one of your endpoints should return legal JSON.

Script alta3research-requests02.py should demonstrate proficiency with the requests HTTP library. The API we target is up to us, but we should insure any data that is returned is "normalized" into a format that is easy for users to understand.
