# alta3research-mycode-cert (API design with Python Certification Project)

The objective of this little project is to obtain a Python and RESTful API Certification demonstrating basic proficiency of Python and RESTful APIs.

The script alta3research-flask01.py should demonstrate proficiency with the flask library. Application should have at least two endpoints. At least one of the endpoints should return legal JSON.

Script alta3research-requests02.py should demonstrate proficiency with the requests HTTP library. The API we target is up to us, but we should insure any data that is returned is "normalized" into a format that is easy for users to understand.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine
for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project
on a live system.

### Prerequisites


------------------------------------------------------
TO RUN THE "alta3research-requests02.py" PROGRAM:
As explained in the file "alta3research-requests02.py", this program requires your personal API key that you can generate here:
https://quickfs.net/features/public-api

Then, you need to put that key in a file named "my_quickfs_key" in a directory.
And put this file in the path you will have specified in the variable "key_path" just below the initial imports in the program.

For example:  key_path = "/home/student/.ssh/"
